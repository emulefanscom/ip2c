The project was inactive from 2014 to 2021, but was reactivated in November 2021.

The code was imported from [code.google.com/archive/p/ip2c](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ip2c/), but the git repo is now intentionally left empty as it's not meaningful to manage ip-to-country.csv file with git. The git history still exist, and the "Releases" is still in use. You can find the [eMule format ip-to-country.csv converter in `ip-to-country-csv-converter` repo](https://github.com/emulefanscom/ip-to-country-csv-converter), and [countryflag32.dll source files and flag images in `countryflag-emule` repo](https://github.com/emulefanscom/countryflag-emule).
